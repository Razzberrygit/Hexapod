This code is for driving a 18 servo Hexapod robot.
for this project Im using an arduino 2560 pro and the Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver with exrtra servos connected to the micro controller with servo.h.

This was a prosonal project and I would be difficult to mold this for a different project but you're welcome to tak inspiration.
